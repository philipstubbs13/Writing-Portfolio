									<a href="assets/writing_samples/heuristic_evaluation.pdf" target="_blank">Heuristic Evaluation</a>
									<p>This is a heuristic evaluation that I completed for WRIT 4501 Usability and Human Factors in Technical Communication. This was a report in which I applied Jakob Nielsen’s 10 <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html" target="_blank">web heuristics</a> to the client’s, Hennepin County Library’s, website. As an evaluator of the <a href="http://www.hclib.org" target="_blank">Hennepin County Library website</a>, I pointed out strengths in the site as well as areas for improvement. The conclusion of the report summarizes the complete evaluation.

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/critical_literacy_project.pdf" target="_blank">Critical Literacy Project</a>
									<p>This is a critical literacy paper that I wrote for WRIT 3244 Critical Literacies: How Words Change the World. This paper examines the progress (and failure) of the women’s rights movement in Afghanistan. The purpose of this project was to challenge my readers to think differently about justice, freedom, and equality in a post-911 world. I critically analyzed four presidential speeches from President Barack Obama and discussed how they challenged ideas about the logic of masculine protection, women’s rights, and the movement towards global democracy.</p>

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/food security and technology.pdf" target="_blank">Food Security and Technology</a>
									<p>This is a paper that explores a current issue in science and technology that I wrote for WRIT 3152 Writing on Issues of Science and Technology. Specifically, it analyzes the public, scientific debate about food security and technology. In addition, it makes the argument for the transfer and access of biotechnology products for poor, malnourished people in Sub- Saharan Africa. The core of the food security debate in the 21st century is the issue of access to food and technological resources for agriculture. As you read through this paper, the important questions in this debate that you should think about are the following:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Who will have access to the biotechnology products like genetically modified organisms?</li>
										<li>What are the benefits, challenges, and risks of globalization and increased availability of such technology?</li>
									</ul>

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/design analysis wii.pdf" target="_blank">Design Analysis of Wii Remote</a>
									<p>This is a design analysis of the Nintendo Wii Remote, which I wrote for WRIT 4501 Usability and Human Factors in Technical Communication.  For this project, I selected an “everyday thing” from my house that has interesting usability aspects. Given the Nintendo Wii Remote, I identified and applied the following design principles from Donald Norman’s <cite>Design of EveryDay Things</cite>:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Conceptual model</li>
										<li>Affordances</li>
										<li>Constraints</li>
										<li>Feedback</li>
										<li>Mapping</li>
									</ul>

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/Visual Rhetorical Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">Visual Rhetorical Anaylsis</a>
									<p>This is a visual rhetorical analysis of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/" target="_blank">BBC news home page</a> that I wrote for WRIT 3671 Visual Rhetoric and Document Design.  This project includes an overview of the rhetorical situation (audience, purpose, and context) for the BBC news home page; an analysis of the intra-level, inter-level, and supra-level design elements on this page; and an analysis of the rhetorical strategies that this page uses, including arrangement, emphasis, clarity, ethos, and tone design strategies. At the end of the document, you will find screen shots of the BBC page with callout boxes that visually summarize the analysis.</p>

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/Textbook cover instructions.pdf" target="_blank">Textbook Cover Instructions</a>
									<p>This is a set of instructions that I put together for WRIT 3562 Technical and Professional Writing. It is a two-page instructional document that goes through the steps on how to cover a textbook with a grocery paper bag. I wrote these instructions for a high school and college audience, but younger students should be easily able to follow along with an adult’s help and guidance. Feel free to share these instructions with teachers, students, and others who may need a quick how-to on how to cover their textbooks for their classes so that books do not become damaged.</p>

									<a href="assets/writing_samples/The War on Salt.pdf" target="_blank">Public Concen about Salt</a>
									<p>This is a paper that I wrote for WRIT 3152 Writing on Issues of Science and Technology. It was written to address the public concern and the politics behind the effects of salt in people’s diets. I wrote this paper to inform the public about a relevant, important issue in science and to go against the conventional wisdom that lowering salt intake in a person’s diet will increase health in the future. In other words, the popular response from the government and the FDA is to recommend lowering sodium consumption. In this paper, I argue that these public health recommendations from the government conflict with the uncertainty of science and the skepticism of epidemiological studies. This paper won me the Coaxley Ames Writing Award at the University of Minnesota in 2012. The award included a scholarship of $1000.</p>
